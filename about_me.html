            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Alexis Trejo, a passionate backend developer with a knack for solving complex problems. Although I don't have a formal degree or professional experience, I've immersed myself in coding and technology through self-learning and hands-on projects.</p>
            
            <p>My journey into backend development began with a fascination for how things work behind the scenes. I started by building small projects and gradually tackled more challenging problems. Each line of code has been a step towards mastering backend development.</p>
            
            <p>Over the past year, I’ve honed my skills in Java, Go, and Python. My projects include creating backend APIs with various architectures and technologies.</p>
            
            <p>Some of my notable personal projects are <a href="[Link to AT_Drugstore_Backend]">AT_Drugstore_Backend</a> and <a href="[Link to Architecture_School_System]">Architecture_School_System</a>. Each project has been a valuable learning experience, allowing me to explore new technologies and apply best practices.</p>
            
            <p>Learning is a core part of my journey. I continuously explore new technologies and methodologies to stay updated with industry trends. My goal is to keep growing and adapting in this ever-evolving field.</p>
        
            <p>Computers and technology are not just a profession for me; they are my life and passion. I am deeply engrossed in the world of technology, and coding is more than a job—it's a way of life. Every challenge I encounter, every line of code I write, is a testament to my dedication and love for this field.</p>
            
            <p>Looking ahead, I aim to further develop my skills as a Backend Developer and continue learning every day. I’m excited about the future and the opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
            
            <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy creating graphic designs on my computer and, outside of the screen, I love reading books and hiking. These interests keep me inspired and energized.</p>
            
            <p>Feel free to explore my projects on <a href="[GitHub/Portfolio link]">GitHub</a>, or connect with me on <a href="[LinkedIn/Twitter link]">LinkedIn</a>. I’m always open to new opportunities and collaborations!</p>
